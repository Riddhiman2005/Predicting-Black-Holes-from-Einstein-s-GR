# Predicting Black-Holes from Einstein's GR #

The presence of Black Holes was predicted by Albert Einstein through his groundbreaking theory of General Relativity in 1915[1]. Black Holes 
are the regions in space where gravity is extraordinarily strong where nothing, not even light can escape. 
The \textbf{Event Horizon/Schwarzschild Radius} represents the boundary beyond which nothing, including light, can escape the gravitational pull of a black hole.

According to the theory of general relativity, the Schwarzschild radius is the radius of a non-rotating black hole that has a mass M. It is defined by the equation:

$$R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}$$

where $R_s$ is the Schwarzschild radius, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum.


Over the past century, numerous observational and theoretical studies have provided compelling evidence for the existence of these enigmatic cosmic objects [2]. In April 2019,  the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration captured the first-ever image of a black hole's shadow.The image captured by the EHT was of the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy Messier 87 (M87). It provided visual evidence of the black hole's event horizon, confirming the existence of black holes and supporting the predictions of general relativity.
This overview provides a concise summary of our current understanding of black hole formation and the supporting evidence that stems from the predictions of general relativity. 
This article focuses on the remarkable connection between Sir Roger Penrose's discovery of black holes and the solid predictions made by the general theory of relativity. Specifically, we explore the singularity theorem, Penrose's seminal contribution to post-Einsteinian general relativity, which introduced the pivotal concept of a closed trapped surface.
